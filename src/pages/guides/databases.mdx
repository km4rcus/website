## What are databases?

A database is an organized collection of data. As databases become more complex they are often developed using formal design and modeling techniques. Databases may be classified into two different types: Relational, where the data is modeled as rows and columns in a series of tables and use SQL for writing and querying data; and non-relational, or NoSQL databases, which contains subgroups such as Document databases and key-value databases. [1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Database)

## Why is this important for hybrid cloud developers?

Where traditional relational databases worked well for general purpose use cases, NoSQL databases took advantage of the elasticity and scalability offered by cloud computing.


## Solution Sketch

* Document databases: general purpose
* Key-value: large amounts of data with simple lookup queries
* Graph: analyzing and traversing relationships between connected data

## Limitations

* TBD
