## What is big data?

Data is getting larger, more complex, and moving faster than ever &mdash; a growth that is largely spurred by the widespread adoption of cloud computing.

With so many computers around the world connecting and transmitting data via the cloud, the challenge for developers is how to harness enormous amounts of data in a meaningful way.

## Why is this important for hybrid cloud developers?

TBD

## Solution Sketch

* [solution or solution sketche(s)]

(batch data processing with Spark; real-time data processing with Kafka; data catalog)

## Limitations

* [limits to approach]

## Key open source projects

* [Spark](https://spark.apache.org/)
* [Kafka](https://kafka.apache.org/)
* [Flink](https://flink.apache.org/)

## Cloud comparision

* [at least two public clouds as examples]
